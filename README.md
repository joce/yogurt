Yahoo!-Originated Graphs, Histories, Updates, Returns & Tickers.

Yoghurt brings Yahoo Finance's HTTP endpoints to the command line. It is built
for scripts, agents, and quick terminal work that needs the JSON returned by
Yahoo's finance endpoints.

The project stays deliberately close to the source. It does not reshape Yahoo
responses, define finance domain models, or add a discovery API beyond CLI
help.

## Features

- Raw Yahoo Finance JSON on stdout, with no pretty-printing or interpretation.
- Endpoint-specific commands for common Yahoo Finance data.
- A SQL-flavored DSL (`screener`, `visualization`) for ad-hoc filters and
  cross-entity queries against Yahoo's data-platform endpoints.
- Generated help that includes examples, parameters, field references, modules,
  or types when Yoghurt knows them.
- Reusable Yahoo session cache for faster one-shot CLI calls.
- A `raw` command for Yahoo query paths that do not have dedicated metadata yet.

## Install From Source

Yoghurt is currently intended to run from a local checkout. It is a Python 3.10+
project managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```powershell
uv sync --all-groups
```

Run the CLI from the repository:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt --help
```

Or install it as a package from a local checkout:

```powershell
uv tool install .
yoghurt --help
```

## Quick Start

Fetch quotes for a few symbols:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt quote AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

Request specific quote fields:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt quote AAPL,MSFT --fields symbol,longName,companyLogoUrl,regularMarketPrice,overnightMarketPrice
```

See [QUOTE_FIELDS.md](src/yoghurt/docs/QUOTE_FIELDS.md) for the full quote field reference and
best-effort meanings.

Fetch selected quote summary modules:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt quote-summary ^GSPC --modules price,summaryDetail,pageViews,financialsTemplate
```

See [QUOTE_SUMMARY_MODULES.md](src/yoghurt/docs/QUOTE_SUMMARY_MODULES.md) for the researched
quote-summary module list and descriptions.

Fetch quote-type metadata using Yahoo's path-symbol endpoint:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt quote-type ^GSPC
```

Fetch chart data for a recent window:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt chart AAPL
```

Fetch quote-page sparkline data:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt spark AAPL,MSFT
```

Quote-page probes have observed `1d` and `24h` spark ranges; pass values such
as `--range 24h` through when Yahoo supports them.

Fetch recommended symbols for a quote page:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt recommendations-by-symbol AAPL
```

Fetch Yahoo calendar events:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt calendar-events AAPL
uv run yoghurt calendar-events AAPL --modules ipoEvents
uv run yoghurt calendar-events AAPL --modules secReports
uv run yoghurt calendar-events AAPL --modules economicEvents --include-all-economic-events
```

Confirmed `--modules` values for `calendar-events`:

| Module | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `earnings` | Upcoming and recent earnings dates and EPS estimates (default). |
| `economicEvents` | Macro economic calendar events (CPI, Fed decisions, employment reports, etc.). |
| `ipoEvents` | Upcoming and recent IPO events. |
| `secReports` | Recent SEC filing events (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, etc.). |

Fetch sector data:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt sector technology
uv run yoghurt sector financial-services --with-returns
```

Confirmed sector slugs: `technology`, `financial-services`, `consumer-cyclical`,
`communication-services`, `healthcare`, `industrials`, `consumer-defensive`,
`energy`, `basic-materials`, `real-estate`, `utilities`.

Run a predefined Yahoo screener:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt screener-predefined MOST_ACTIVES
uv run yoghurt screener-predefined DAY_GAINERS_CRYPTOCURRENCIES
uv run yoghurt screener-predefined TOP_OPTIONS_OPEN_INTEREST
```

Fetch an option chain using Yahoo's default expiration:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt options AAPL
```

Fetch current market session status and trading hours:

```powershell

```

Run a custom screener or cross-entity query with the SQL-flavored DSL:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt screener --query "
  SELECT ticker, intradaymarketcap, sector, peratio.lasttwelvemonths
  FROM EQUITY
  WHERE region = 'us'
    AND sector = 'Technology'
    AND intradaymarketcap >= 10e9
  ORDER BY intradaymarketcap DESC
  LIMIT 25"

uv run yoghurt visualization --query "
  SELECT ticker, transactiondate, shares
  FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTION
  WHERE ticker = 'AAPL'
  ORDER BY transactiondate DESC
  LIMIT 50"
```

List the fields, types, and operators available for a given asset class or
entity (e.g. for use in a `screener` or `visualization` query):

```powershell
uv run yoghurt screener-instrument-fields equity
uv run yoghurt screener-instrument-fields insider_transaction
```

See [QUERY_DSL.md](src/yoghurt/docs/QUERY_DSL.md) for the full DSL reference: grammar,
operators, entity routing, body shape, premium-locked entities, and more
examples.

Pass through a Yahoo query path directly:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt raw /v7/finance/quote --param symbols=AAPL,MSFT --param formatted=true
```

Each endpoint has its own adaptive help:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt quote --help
uv run yoghurt quote-summary --help
uv run yoghurt calendar-events --help
uv run yoghurt timeseries --help
```

Endpoint help is the primary documentation surface. It shows Yahoo's target
endpoint, accepted parameters, defaults, examples, and common open-ended values
where available.

### Chart

The `chart` command calls Yahoo's `/v8/finance/chart/{symbol}` endpoint without
requesting a crumb:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt chart AAPL
```

When period arguments are omitted, Yoghurt uses a recent quote-page-shaped
window: `period1` defaults to three days before execution time, `period2`
defaults to execution time, `--interval` defaults to `1m`, and `--events`
defaults to `div,split,earn`. User-provided events are comma-separated; Yoghurt
packs them for Yahoo internally. Extended-hours data is opt-in with
`--include-pre-post`.

### Timeseries

The `timeseries` command can also run with only a ticker:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt timeseries AAPL
```

Its default type list matches the Yahoo quote/analysis page request for
earnings-release, analyst-rating, and economic-event timeseries data. When
period arguments are omitted, Yoghurt uses a recent quote-page-style window:
`period1` defaults to three days before execution time and `period2` defaults
to execution time.

See [TIMESERIES_TYPES.md](src/yoghurt/docs/TIMESERIES_TYPES.md) for the observed `--type`
reference with descriptions.

## Dates and Booleans

Date and datetime parameters accept:

- Unix timestamps, such as `1510876800`.
- Date-only values, such as `2017-11-17`.
- ISO datetime values.

Date-only values are converted at UTC midnight before they are sent to Yahoo.
For endpoints with `period1` and `period2`, documented defaults let ticker-only
requests run, `period2` defaults to the current Unix timestamp when omitted, and
Yoghurt rejects windows where `period2` is not greater than `period1`. Supplying
`period2` without `period1` is also rejected.

Boolean parameters accept common true and false forms such as `true`, `false`,
`1`, `0`, `yes`, and `no`.

## Session Cache

Most Yahoo endpoints require a cookie and crumb. Yoghurt establishes that session
state automatically and caches it for reuse across CLI calls.

Useful global options:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt --refresh-session quote AAPL
uv run yoghurt --no-session-cache quote AAPL
uv run yoghurt --session-cache C:\tmp\yoghurt-session.json quote AAPL
```

Yoghurt never prints cookies, crumbs, or full session-cache contents.

## Output Contract

Yoghurt writes the Yahoo response body to stdout exactly as returned. This makes
it easy to pipe into tools that expect JSON:

```powershell
uv run yoghurt quote AAPL | jq .
```

Diagnostics and errors are written to stderr.

## Development

Install development dependencies:

```powershell
uv sync --all-groups
```

Run the test suite:

```powershell
uv run pytest
```

Run checks locally:

```powershell
uv run black --check .
uv run ruff format --check --diff .
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
uv run pytest -n auto
```

Run the full project check, including Python checks and spelling:

```powershell
uv run tox
```

When adding or changing command metadata, update validation, adaptive help, and
tests together. Then verify the relevant command against Yahoo with its help,
minimal required parameters, and representative optional parameters.
