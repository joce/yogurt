# Quote Fields

The `quote` command accepts an optional `--fields` value for Yahoo quote fields:

```powershell
uv run yogurt quote AAPL,MSFT --fields symbol,longName,companyLogoUrl,regularMarketPrice,overnightMarketPrice
```

Yogurt passes field names through to Yahoo without validation. Availability
depends on the symbol, instrument type, exchange, region, and the current Yahoo
response shape.

`morningstarIndustry` is included because Yahoo returns it for some quote
requests and Yogurt uses it in quote examples.
