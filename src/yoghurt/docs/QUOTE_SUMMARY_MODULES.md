# Quote Summary Modules

`yoghurt quote-summary` passes the `--modules` value through to Yahoo Finance's
`/v10/finance/quoteSummary/{symbol}` endpoint. Yoghurt does not validate module
names, and Yahoo can vary availability by instrument type.

These module names were researched from Yahoo Finance client metadata and live
Yoghurt probes against Yahoo's raw quote summary endpoint. Equity probes used
`AAPL`; fund-specific probes used `VT`.

## Research Notes

- `AAPL` populated the equity-focused modules, including financial statements,
  holders, trends, recommendations, price, quote type, and `equityPerformance`.
- `VT` populated the fund-specific `fundProfile`, `fundPerformance`, and
  `topHoldings` modules.
- Index quote pages were observed requesting `price`, `summaryDetail`,
  `pageViews`, `financialsTemplate`, `calendarEvents`,
  `quoteUnadjustedPerformanceOverview`, `corporateActions`,
  `earningsCallTranscripts`, `earningsGaap`, `earningsNonGaap`, and
  `upgradeDowngradeHistory`.
- `esgScores` appears in older third-party references, but live Yahoo probes
  returned HTTP 404 for `AAPL`, so it is not listed as a supported module here.
